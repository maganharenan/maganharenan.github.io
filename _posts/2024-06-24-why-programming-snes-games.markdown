Before diving into the technical aspects of game development, I want to share what inspired me to start learning how ot create games for old hardware consoles. Let's take a trip back to the 90s, the decade I was born.<br><br>

There's something magical about the old days of gaming, isn't there? The pixelated graphics, the chiptune soundtracks, the sheer joy of popping a cartridge into a console â€“ it's an experience that today's high-definition, photorealistic games just can't replicate. My journey into the world of programming games for old console hardware like the SNES is rooted in this deep-seated nostalgia.

I was born in 1993, and my parents already had some consoles and computers at home. Unfortunately, I can't remember all the details about that time. My first console was the Sega Master System, though I don't have any memories of playing it. The earliest memory I have of playing a game is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jV9lkyY6meI?feature=share">Frogger</a> on my dad's old PC. I can't remember if it was a Macintosh, the MSX, or another type of PC. Speaking of the MSX, I don't recall playing on it, but I know I did because my family has a bunch of pictures of me playing something on it. What I can clearly remember of that time was the good moments that my family spent playing the Super Nintendo. Damn, that console was good. I saw my dad and my uncle finishing Contra 3, saw them playing International Superstar Soccer and Mortal Kombat with my grandpa, saw my mother beating games like Wild Guns and Power Pigs of the Dark Age. And of course, I had my own adventures in that console playing Super Mario World, Sparkster, F-Zero and so much other amazing games. 

The only console that had the same impact on me that super nintendo did was the Playstation One.
