Before diving into the technical aspects of game development, I want to share what inspired me to start creating games for old hardware consoles. Let's take a trip back to the 90s, the decade I was born.

The 90s was such a great decade full of great music, awesome consoles, and fantastic games. As you can imagine, I was exposed to all of this during my early years. 

I was born in 1993, and at that time my parents already had some consoles and computers at home, but unfortunately I can't remember about all that stuff. For example, my first console was the Sega Master System, though, unfortunately, I don't have any memories of playing it. The earliest memory I have of playing a game is playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jV9lkyY6meI?feature=share">Frogger</a> on my dad's old PC â€” I can't remember if it was a macintosh, the MSX or any other PC.

Talking about the MSX, I can't even remember that I played on that someday, I only know that I did because my family has a bunch of pictures of me
