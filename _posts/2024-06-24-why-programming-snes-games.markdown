Before diving into the technical aspects of game development, I want to share what inspired me to start learning how ot create games for old hardware consoles. Let's take a trip back to the 90s, the decade I was born.<br><br>

There's something magical about the old days of gaming, isn't there? The pixelated graphics, the chiptune soundtracks, the sheer joy of popping a cartridge into a console – it's an experience that today's high-definition, photorealistic games just can't replicate. My journey into the world of programming games for old console hardware like the SNES is rooted in this deep-seated nostalgia.

I was born in 1993, and my parents already had some consoles and computers at home. Unfortunately, I can't remember all the details about that time, but I'll share what I do remember. My first console was the Sega Master System, though I don't have any memories of playing it. The earliest memory I have of playing a game is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jV9lkyY6meI?feature=share">Frogger</a> on my dad's old PC. I can't remember if it was a Macintosh, the MSX, or another type of PC. Speaking of the MSX, I don't recall playing on it, but I know I did because my family has a bunch of pictures of me playing something on it. What I can clearly remember from that time are the good moments my family spent playing the Super Nintendo. That console was amazing. I watched my dad and uncle finish Contra 3, saw them playing International Superstar Soccer and Mortal Kombat with my grandpa, and also saw my mom beating games like Wild Guns, Power Pigs of the Dark Age and Top Gear.

By the way, the SNES was the first console that I can remember I played. When I was about 4 years old I was playing games like Super Mario World, Super Mario Kart, Prince of Persia and some Power Rangers game.<br>
When I was 5 my first SNES died (A lightning strike hit the power grid at my house and damaged some devices). And the next year my dad bought a Sega Sapturn, but the only game he bought was the Mortal Kombat. I used to like playing MK on Sega, but I wasn't too attached to this console.<br>
2 years after getting the Sapturn – and don't ask me what happened to the Sega Sapturn because I don't know – my dad bought us another SNES, and then I met some great games of SNES: Sparkster, Xardion, The Blues Brothers, S.O.S, Road Runner: Death Valley Rally, Tiny Toon Adventures: Busters Busts Lose, F-Zero, Batman Returns and so on. Actualy, most of this games I still play until today.

The only console that had the same impact on me that super nintendo did was the Playstation One.
