Before diving into the technical aspects of game development, I want to share what inspired me to start learning how ot create games for old hardware consoles. Let's take a trip back to the 90s, the decade I was born.<br><br>

There's something magical about the old days of gaming, isn't there? The pixelated graphics, the chiptune soundtracks, the sheer joy of popping a cartridge into a console – it's an experience that today's high-definition, photorealistic games just can't replicate. My journey into the world of programming games for old console hardware like the SNES is rooted in this deep-seated nostalgia.

I was born in 1993, and my parents already had some consoles and computers at home. Unfortunately, I can't remember all the details about that time, but I'll share what I do remember. My first console was the Sega Master System, though I don't have any memories of playing it. The earliest memory I have of playing a game is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jV9lkyY6meI?feature=share">Frogger</a> on my dad's old PC. I can't remember if it was a Macintosh, the MSX, or another type of PC. Speaking of the MSX, I don't recall playing on it, but I know I did because my family has a bunch of pictures of me playing something on it. What I can clearly remember from that time are the good moments my family spent playing the Super Nintendo. That console was amazing. I watched my dad and uncle finish Contra 3, saw them playing International Superstar Soccer and Mortal Kombat with my grandpa, and also saw my mom beating games like Wild Guns, Power Pigs of the Dark Age and Top Gear.<br><br>

By the way, the SNES was the first console I can remember playing. When I was about 4 years old, I was playing games like Super Mario World, Super Mario Kart, Prince of Persia, and some Power Rangers game.<br><br>

When I was 5, my first SNES died (a lightning strike hit the power grid at my house and damaged some devices). The next year, my dad bought a Sega Saturn, but the only game he got was Mortal Kombat. I enjoyed playing MK on the Sega, but I wasn't too attached to that console.<br><br>

Two years after getting the Saturn – and don't ask me what happened to it because I don't know – my dad bought us another SNES. That's when I discovered some great SNES games: Sparkster, Xardion, The Blues Brothers, S.O.S, Road Runner: Death Valley Rally, Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose, F-Zero, Batman Returns, and so on. Actually, I still play most of these games today. That's when playing SNES became such a great part of my childhood.

Close to the SNES acquisition, my uncle brought us a CD with some games. I thought it was a CD-ROM with some random games, but to my surprise, the CD had almost 600 ROMs of Sega Genesis games. About two years after getting the CD, I found out that it also had a few N64 games like Zelda: Majora's Mask, Pokémon Stadium, and 007. That was the first time I played N64 games.<br><br>

But let's get back to the Genesis. This CD was a game changer. Before, I was limited to my SNES games, and if I wanted to play something new, I had to borrow it from someone or buy the game. But now, with a lot of games on just one CD, I was unstoppable. I played lots of fun games, including Sonic (all of them available for Genesis), B.O.B, Pulseman, Ristar, High Seas Havoc, Two Crude Dudes, Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, Alex Kidd, Zero Kamikaze, Cool Spot, and Aero the Acrobat. This experience was very important in solidifying my taste for games and sparking my interest in creating my first game. At that time, I didn't know how games were made, but I was eager to find out.<br><br>
