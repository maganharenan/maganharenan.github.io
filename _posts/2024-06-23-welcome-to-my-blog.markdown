Hey there! Welcome to my blog. I have been postponing starting this blog for such a long time, but today I decided to roll up my sleeves and get busy with it.

Well, I already had some blogs when I was younger. In fact, I've been into blogs since 2008. I remember the hours I spend on blogs searching for Lacrimas Profundere, HIM, Katatonia, and other band albums. Also, I had my own blogs that were dedicated to sharing my band's songs and lyrics (it was a terrible idea since none of the songs were copyrighted and anyone could steal them). After a long time without publishing anything, I decided to create this blog to share the stuff I've been learning over the last few years and talk about hobbies and other interests. I hope that this blog can be a dump of my memories, a place where I can visit to remember what I've learned, see how I used to think, and measure how much I've evolved from there.

I have many interests like drawing, pixel art, music, and writing, and I will probably talk about all of them at some point. However, the main subject of this blog will be programming, especially developing applications for the Apple ecosystem and programming for old game hardware like the SNES, Sega Genesis, and PlayStation. Regarding programming for old hardware, I am still learning about it, so I hope to accelerate this process by exposing my work to you guys and learning from you. Of course, I hope the shared content can help people who are starting to learn that too.

So, stick around! Iâ€™m excited to share my journey with you. Whether you're here for the programming, the art, the music, or anything else, there's something for everyone.

Thanks for stopping by, and see you in the next post!
